Task 5 - basic math operations

Your task is to check in action every basic math operators with combination of integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers and booleans. Do at least two calculations for every operator. Also make use of round() function to round your floating point results to specific number of decimals.
You can mix integer with floats inside given math operation.
Hint: You can assign math operation to a variable, and then perform another math operation on this variable, for example:
a = 2/3
print(round(a, 2))  # result is 0.67

Check what happens after division by zero :smiley:

Some of your results could look like this:

12 + 34 = 46
43 - 56 = -13
4 * 4 = 16
4 / 5 = 0.8
12 % 5 = 2
2 ** 4 = 16
12.2 // 3 = 4.0
True * False = 0
5 * (2 - 3j) = (10-15j)"""

print(f"{32 + 23 = }\n{45 + 23 = }\n{32 - 23 = }\n{4 - 23 = }\n{3*3 = }\n{4*0 = }\n{3/0.5 = }\n{45/0.35 = }\n{90 % 45 = }\n{5 % 2 = }")
print(f"{3 ** 3 = }\n{0.5 ** 4 = }\n{32 // 3 = }\n{4 // 2 = }\n{35 // 3 = }\n{4//0.5 = }\n{3+0.5/3-5.6 = }\n{True * False = }\n{5 % (3-5) = }\n{5 + (4*(52 // 5)) - 2 = }")
